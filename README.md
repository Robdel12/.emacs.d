# My own Emacs config

If you'd like to use my config, simply clone this repo into `~/.emacs.d`.

If you make any changes, including adding snippets, features, or languages, feel
free to contribute them back here!

### Prerequisites

This list is probably not definitive. If you find you need to install other
things to get the config to work properly, please create an issue so I can add
it to the list.

- To enable all-the-icons in the modeline, install them through emacs with `M-x
  all-the-icons-install-fonts`.

- To use spell-checking, install `ispell`: `brew install ispell`

- To use ag, install `the_silver_searcher`: `brew install
  the_silver_searcher`

- To see flycheck errors in JS, install `eslint`: `npm install -g eslint`
